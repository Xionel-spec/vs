        <p>To determine how many small cubes are on the surface of a 7 × 7 × 7 cube made up of 7^3 = 343 small cubes, we need to calculate the number of cubes that form the surface.</p>

<p>The formula for the number of small cubes on the surface of a cube with side length 
        n is given by 6n^2. Here, n=7:</br>
    6 × 7^2 = 6 × 49 = 294</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of small cubes on the surface of the large cube is 294</p>
