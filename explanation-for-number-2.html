        <p>To solve the problem, we need to find a number n that satisfies the following congruences:</p>
        <p>1.	n ≡ 1(mod5)</p>
        <p>2.	n ≡ 1(mod6)</p>
        <p>3.	n ≡ 2 (mod7)</p>
        <section>
<p>We can start by solving the first two congruences together. Notice that if n ≡ 1 (mod5) and n ≡ 1 (mod6), then n ≡ 1 {modlcm(5,6)}. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30, so:
            <p></br>n ≡ 1 (mod30)</p>
    <p>Next, we need to solve the combined congruence n ≡ 1 (mod30) with n ≡ 2 (mod7).</p>
    <p>Let's write n as 30k + 1 for some integer k. Substituting this into the second congruence:</p>
    <p>30k + 1 ≡ 2 (mod7)</br>30k ≡ 1 (mod7)</p>
    <p>Since 30 ≡ 2 (mod7), we substitute:</p>
2k ≡ 1 (mod7)
    <p>Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 7. We look for a number x such that:</p>
<p>2x ≡ 1(mod7)(mod7)
    By testing values, we find:</p>
    <p>2 × 4 = 8 ≡ 1 (mod7)</p>
    <p>So, x = 4x. Therefore, k ≡ 4 (mod7), which means k = 7m + 4 for some integer m.</p>
    <p>Substituting k back into n:</p>
    <p>n = 30 (7m+4) + 1 = 210m + 121</p>
<p>So, n ≡ 121 (mod210). This means the smallest positive n is 121. Now we need to check if any of the given answer choices are factors of 121:</p>
    <p>121 = 11 × 11</p>
The factors of 121 are 1, 11, and 121. Among the provided options (4, 11, 13, 17, none of the above), the correct choice is B
