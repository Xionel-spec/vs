     <p>Let's denote the numbers on the sides of the cube as a,b,c,d,e,f, where a and b are on opposite sides, c and d are on opposite sides, and e and f are on opposite sides. The condition given is that the products of numbers on each pair of opposite sides are all the same.</p> 
        <p>Let this common product be P. Then we have the following equations:</p>
        <p>ab = P</p>
        <p>cd = P</p>
        <p>ef = P</p>
        <p>To find the lowest possible sum <b>S</b> = a + b + c + d + e + f, we need to consider integer pairs (a,b), (c,d), (e,f) such that ab = cd = ef = <b>P</b> and a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers.</p>
        <p>Let's explore the potential pairs to minimize <b>S</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>(a,b) = (1,P), (c,d) = (2,P/2), (e,f) = (4,P/4):</br>
        a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + P + 2 + P/2 + 4 + P/4</br>
    Simplifying this:</br>
S = 7 + P + P/2 + P/4</br>
S = 7 + (1 + 1/2 + 1/4)P</br>
S = 7 + 7/4 P</li>
<li>To minimize S, choose P = 4 (the smallest integer that can be a product):</br>
S = 7 + 7/4 . 4 = 7+ 7 = 14</br></li>
</ol>
Verify:</br>
<ul>
<li>ab = 1 . 4 = 4</li>
<li>cd = 2 . 2 = 4</li>
<li>ef = 4 . 1 = 4</li>    
</ul>
<p>Thus, P = 4 satisfies the condition. Therefore, the lowest possible sum of all the numbers on the sides of the cube is 14.</p>
