        <p>Let's analyze each statement to determine which is true:</p>
        <p>Statement (a)</br>
    <b>"The graph of a horizontal line can’t have any x-intercepts."</br>
    A horizontal line has the equation y = c for some constant c. It can have x-intercepts if c = 0 (i.e., the x-axis itself). Thus, this statement is false because a horizontal line can have an x-intercept when it lies on the x-axis.</b>
</p>
<p>Statement (b)</br>
<b>"The graph of a horizontal line can’t have a unique x-intercept, but may have more than one x-intercept."</br>
As analyzed above, a horizontal line can either have no x-intercept (if c ≠ 0) or an infinite number of x-intercepts (if c = 0). Therefore, this statement is false because a horizontal line can have exactly one x-intercept if it lies on the x-axis and c = 0.</b>
</p>
<p>Statement (c)</br>
<b>"The graph of a parabola can’t have a unique x-intercept, but may have more than one x-intercept."</br>
A parabola described by y = ax^2 + bx + c  can have:</br>
•	No x-intercept if the discriminant b^2 − 4ac is negative.</br>
•	Exactly one x-intercept if the discriminant b^2 − 4ac is zero (a double root).<br>
•	Two distinct x-intercepts if the discriminant b^2 − 4ac is positive.</br>
Thus, this statement is false because a parabola can have a unique x-intercept.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Statement (d)</p>
<p>"The graph of a polynomial of degree three or higher must have at least one x-intercept."</br>

A polynomial of degree three or higher is a continuous function and, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it must have at least one real root (x-intercept). This is due to the fact that polynomials of odd degree (like degree three) have at least one real root since they extend to <b>±∞ as x → ±∞</b>. For even degree polynomials higher than two, they can also have real roots.
</p>
<p>Statement (e)</p>
<p>"Either none are true or more than one are true."</br>

From our analysis, we see that:
<ul>
    <li>Statements (a), (b), and (c) are false.</li>
    <li>Statement (d) is true.</li></ul>
Therefore, statement (d) is the only true statement.</p>
