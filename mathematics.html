<li> Consider the equation p(x) : ax2 + bx + c = 0 whose coefficients a, b and c are all non-zero,
and each of them satisfies an equation that results from removing the term containing that
coefficent from the equation p(x); for example, the coefficient b is a solution of the equation
ax2 + c = 0. What is the sum of all solutions of p(x)?

<li> A marching band has 150 members. One day only part of them show up, but nobody wants
to take the time to count how many there are. They first line up in rows with 5 members each,
but there is one left over. Then they try rows with 6 members each, but there is still one left
over. Then they try rows of 7, but there are two left over. How many people should line up in
each row so no members will be left over?

<li> A person walks along a beach, starting at point A, at
a rate of 3 mi/h and at point B, goes into the water
and swims at a rate of 2 mi/h diagonally out to an island that is a distance of √
3 mi from point C, directly
across from the island on the shore, as shown in the
picture. The total distance from point A to point C is
3 mi. There are two different choices for the distance,
in miles, from point A to point B that will result in a
total time for walking and swimming of one hour and
40 minutes; what is the sum of those numbers?
