 <p>To determine which of the given expressions is equal to 10!, we first need to compute 10! and compare it to the products of the factorials in each option.</p>
        <p>Calculation of 10!</br>
    10!=10×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1</br>
10!=3,628,800</p>
<p>Analysis of the options</p>
<p>Option (a): 5! . 2!</br>
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120</br>
2! = 2 × 1 = 2</br>
5!⋅2!=120⋅2=240</br>
This is not equal to 10!.</p>
<p>Option (b): 7! ⋅ 5! ⋅ 3!</br>
7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040</br>
5! = 120(calculated earlier)</br>
3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6</br>
7!⋅ 5! ⋅ 3! = 5040 ⋅ 120 ⋅ 6 = 3, 628, 800 ⋅ 6 = 21, 772, 800</br>
This is much larger than 10!.</p>
<p>Option (c): 7!⋅5!⋅2!</br>
7! = 5040 (calculated earlier)
</br>5! = 120 (calculated earlier)
</br>2! = 2(calculated earlier)
</br>7! ⋅ 5!⋅ 2! = 5040 ⋅ 120 ⋅ 2 = 5040 ⋅ 240 = 1, 209, 600</br>
This is not equal to 10!.</p>
<p>Option (d): 7! ⋅ 5! ⋅ 3! ⋅ 2!</br>
7! = 5040 (calculated earlier)</br>
5! = 120 (calculated earlier)</br>
3! = 6 (calculated earlier)</br>
2! = 2 (calculated earlier)</br>
7! ⋅ 5! ⋅ 3! ⋅ 2! = 5040 ⋅ 120 ⋅ 6 ⋅ 2 = 5040 ⋅ 1440 = 7, 257, 600</br>
This is not equal to 10!.</p>
<p>Conclusion
None of the provided options (a), (b), (c), or (d) equal 10!.</p>
